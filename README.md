# ALX S.E
## System Engineering & DevOps
The purpose of this repository is to help store the code associated with the ALX S.E System Engineering and DevOps portion of the training. In essence, this is the repository that holds all the code for each of the projects carried out in the course of the first trimester of the ALX Software Engineering training program.

Each of the directories in this repository corresponds to each of the projects undertaken by the student (Prince C. Ngumoha) during the course of the first trimester and each of the files contained within any of these directories corresponds with my solutions to each of the individual tasks in that specific project.
